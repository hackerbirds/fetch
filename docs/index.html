          <strong>Fetch</strong> is an app launcher for macOS where everything
          works instantly.

          Stop wasting your time (literally) with Spotlight, Alfred, Raycast,
          etc. This does one job and one job only: launch apps. We are working
          to make this job as smooth and fast as possible. Here's how to use it:
        </p>
        <img src="app-screenshot.png" />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start the app. Nothing will happen yet, but the app will
            automatically register to launch on boot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the hotkey <b>⌥+Space</b> to instantly activate the search bar.
          </li>
          <li>Search the app you want.</li>
          <li>
            Press Enter to load the first app in the search results, or click on
            one of the results.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There's a lot to do still. It is not ready yet for general release but
          you can build it yourself if you're brave. We're actively working on
          it, and our work and roadmap is public. Come give your feedback on the
          GitHub page!
